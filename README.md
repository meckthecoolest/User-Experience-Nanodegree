# User-Experience-Nanodegree

1. <b>UX Fundamentals and Design Research Project: UX Research🤩</b>

This module serves as an introduction to design psychology and user interface principles, preparing students on how to perform user research by conducting in-depth interviews and creating quantitative surveys, and how to use research data to uncover opportunities. <b>I opted to create my own design problem, to allow for a little more creative freedom.✔️</b>
