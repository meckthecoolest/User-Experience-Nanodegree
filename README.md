# User-Experience-Nanodegree

1. <b>UX Fundamentals and Design Research</b><br>
  <b>Project: UX Research🤩</b>

     This module serves as an introduction to design psychology and user interface principles, preparing students on how to        perform user research by conducting in-depth interviews and creating quantitative surveys, and how to use research data        to uncover opportunities. <b>I opted to create my own design problem, to allow for a little more creative freedom.✔️</b>

2. <b>Concept to Low-Fidelity Prototyping</b><br>
  <b>Project: Low-Fidelity Rapid Prototyping Sprint😍</b>
  
    This module refers how to translate the research findings into a prototype that can be tested by users. Following on from     the first project, you will be tasked with creating a low-fidelity prototype, conducting a usability test to validate         design assumptions, and then creating a second iteration of your prototype based on user feedback.
    
3. <b>High-Fidelity Prototyping to Post-Launch Analysis</b><br>
  <b>Project: Create & Improve a High-Fidelity Design🎉</b>
  
    In terms of the high-fidelity design project, students have to source visual design inspiration, in order to develop a         style guide and component library for their app, and finally, create a clickable mockup. The design will then need to be       reviewed in terms of accessibility, and iterated based on engagement data and key performance indicators.
   
4. <b>Capstone</b><br>
   <b>Project: UX Portfolio Case Study🎓</b>
   
     The Nanodegree wraps up with lessons on how to showcase your designs and processes in a portfolio, in terms of                organising previous work and communicating it online. Instead of developing your own UX portfolio, you’ll be asked            to reflect and document the process you went through to complete your past three projects, organise your assets and            course notes, and then develop an ‘About Me’ page.
